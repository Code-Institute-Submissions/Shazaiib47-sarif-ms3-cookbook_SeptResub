## Project Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

- ### Some Words of Mine...

This project marks my 3rd Milestone on the road to becoming a Full Stack Developer, alongside with Code Institute. Many many obstacles had prevented me
submitting this on time, as well as personal commitments and setbacks happened which had meant this project had to be put on standby as discussed with
the Student Care Team at CI. I am not satisfied with where I had wanted this project to end up being like, but given my personal circumstances, the timeframe
as well as my mental capacity, I could only do so much without the help of fellow students through Slack as well as my own personal mentor, Aaron Sinnott.

This project was done without the help of these people and was done through tough times, however I am proud of continuing this given I was battling depression, anxiety
as well as other factors that had affected my workrate through this milestone project. I am content with where it is but I myself will still continue updating this even 
though I know the outcome of the project. I am aware of what will happen but I will continue to persevere and work my hardest through this. Above all, I hope you thoroughly enjoy reading the documentation that made this website as well as the challenges I had faced.

Thank you for Reading.

- ### Project Scope

The project I have created here is a online cookbook with the theme of Japanese food. It is understood that covering the whole food of Japan would definitely take some huge 
amount of time, to counter this I have focused on 1 city in Japan, the heart of food; which is Tokyo.
The premise of this cookbook is to allow users to delve into the recipes and the great food of Japan by reading recipe additions added by users, as well as giving them the
insight as to what Japanese food consists of and how it looks like.

Japanese cuisine is widely known for its healthy ingredient usage, as well as being recognised for its cultural significance, so therefore It promotes healthy living through
the use of healthy food via their ingredients. This in turn is great as I wanted to focus my online cookbook around this, to promote healthy living and eating.

- ### Project Goal

Japanese food and in particular their cuisine has always been a passion of mine. My aim with this project was to share my love of japanese oriental cuisine with others in hopes
of them getting a glimpse of the types of food they have to offer and if given the chance by trying it too. I know there are many others out there who
enjoy oriental food and I hope to see a variety of recipes being uploaded by users to showcase to people who are passing by the website as well as active users.

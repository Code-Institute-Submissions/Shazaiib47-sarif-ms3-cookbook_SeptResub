## Project Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

- ### Some Words of Mine...

This project marks my 3rd Milestone on the road to becoming a Full Stack Developer, alongside with Code Institute. Many many obstacles had prevented me
submitting this on time, as well as personal commitments and setbacks happened which had meant this project had to be put on standby as discussed with
the Student Care Team at CI. I am not satisfied with where I had wanted this project to end up being like, but given my personal circumstances, the timeframe
as well as my mental capacity, I could only do so much without the help of fellow students through Slack as well as my own personal mentor, Aaron Sinnott.

This project was done without the help of these people and was done through tough times, however I am proud of continuing this given I was battling depression, anxiety
as well as other factors that had affected my workrate through this milestone project. I am content with where it is but I myself will still continue updating this even 
though I know the outcome of the project. I am aware of what will happen but I will continue to persevere and work my hardest through this. 

Thank you for Reading.
